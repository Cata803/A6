If he is on the way to university and choose to go to the bar tell him you are out of the money and give him these options:

If he is on the home and choose to sleep tell him you have to do your university work and give him these options:
1-	Study for your 122COM phase test

•	C++ code has to be compiled before it is run. So does Python it just happens automatically. Compiler converts C++ code into machine code. Many IDEs handle compiling for you. Visual Studio, Eclipse etc. Make you do it yourself in this module so you understand it. Understand what IDE is doing. Understand the configuration options in the IDE. Understand the error messages you get. Once understood then use IDEs.

2-	Write your 20 words report for 106CR 

•	“Doesn’t let him go to the next part until he type 20 words”

*	On the day 6(Saturday)
If he is on the way to university and choose to go to a movie tell him you are one of your friends is here and give him these options:
1-	Continue to go to the cinema and pay for your friends ticket
