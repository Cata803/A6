Hey guys, this my plan for those three accidents that currently  I am doing, any advice and suggestions will be greatly appreciated





**	On the day 2 (Tuesday)
If he chooses to go to the bar tell him you are out of food and give him these options:
1-	Press 1 to go to the shop

2-If press anything show him you need to go to shop
  


                                              --------------------------------------------
                                              --------------------------------------------
                                              
                                              
**	On the day 4(Thursday)
If he is at home tell him you have to do your university work and give him these options:
1-	Study for your 122COM phase test

        •	C++ code has to be compiled before it is run. 
        So does Python it just happens automatically. Compiler converts C++ 
        code into machine code. Many IDEs handle compiling for you. Visual Studio, Eclipse etc.
        Make you do it yourself in this module so you understand it. Understand what IDE is doing.
        Understand the configuration options in the IDE. Understand the error messages you get. 
        Once understood then use IDEs.

2-	Write your report for 106CR 

        • 	“Give him a space to write his report”



                                              --------------------------------------------
                                              --------------------------------------------

**	On the day 6(Saturday)
If he chooses to go to a movie tell him you are one of your friends is here and give him these options:

1-	Invite him to the home to play a game together 

        •	Zara’s part

        • show him library option from uni
