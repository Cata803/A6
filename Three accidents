If he is in the home and chooses to sleep tell him you have to do your university work and give him these options:
1-	Study for your 122COM phase test

        •	C++ code has to be compiled before it is run. 
        So does Python it just happens automatically. Compiler converts C++ 
        code into machine code. Many IDEs handle compiling for you. Visual Studio, Eclipse etc.
        Make you do it yourself in this module so you understand it. Understand what IDE is doing.
        Understand the configuration options in the IDE. Understand the error messages you get. 
        Once understood then use IDEs.

2-	Write your 20 words report for 106CR 

        • 	“The program doesn’t let him go to the next part until he types 20 words”
